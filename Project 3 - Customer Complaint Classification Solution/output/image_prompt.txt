Create a clear, detailed, realistic illustration showing the exact customer complaint: Customer complaint: Hello. I'm calling to complain about a product I purchased. I ordered a smartphone last week. But when it arrived, the screen was cracked and the device wouldn't turn on. This is completely unacceptable. I need a refund immediately.. The image must accurately and clearly show: 1. The specific product or item mentioned in the complaint, 2. The exact type of damage, defect, or issue described (e.g., cracked screen, broken part, wrong size, etc.), 3. The precise location and appearance of the defect, 4. The condition of the product as described. Make the defect highly visible and prominent in the image. Use a clean background to focus attention on the product and defect. The image should be photorealistic and clearly show the complaint issue.
