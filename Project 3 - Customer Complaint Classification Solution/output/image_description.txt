This image shows a smartphone with visible damage to the display. Below is a detailed analysis of the defects, issues, or problems visible in the image:

---

### **Defect 1**: **Cracked Screen**
1. **What the defect is**:
   - The screen is extensively cracked, with multiple fractures radiating from two major impact points.
   
2. **Where it is located in the image**:
   - The cracks extend across the center and right portions of the phone. The **primary impact point** is located slightly to the right of the phone’s midpoint (center-right area), slightly higher than halfway up. A secondary impact point is visible near the **top-right corner**.
   
3. **The size and appearance of the defect**:
   - **Primary Impact Point**:
     - The primary impact appears as a circular shatter pattern with a dense web of cracks spreading outward.
     - The shattered area is about 3-4 cm in diameter, heavily fragmented.
   - **Secondary Impact Point**:
     - The secondary shatter point near the top-right corner has a smaller circular cracking pattern, with an approximate diameter of 1-2 cm. However, cracks emanating from this point merge with the primary cracking network. 
   - Overall, the cracks cover nearly **90% of the screen**, ranging from hairline fractures to deeper, more visible breaks.
   
4. **Other notable visual elements**:
   - The cracks become less dense toward the bottom-left corner but are still visible.
   - A green phone call icon in the bottom-left corner remains intact, indicating the display underneath the glass is still functioning.

### **Defect 2**: **Edge Damage Near the Screen**
1. **What the defect is**:
   - Slight damage to the right bezel/frame of the phone, possibly caused by impact.
   
2. **Where it is located in the image**:
   - Located on the **right edge of the phone**, near the center, in line with the primary impact point on the screen.
   
3. **The size and appearance of the defect**:
   - The right side of the phone appears to have a subtle indentation or scuff on the metal frame. This damage is minor but recognizable under close observation. The width and size of the damaged area are approximately 2-3 mm.

4. **Other notable visual elements**:
   - The scuff highlights how the phone might have endured additional external trauma during the incident causing the screen cracks.

### **General Observations**:
- **The screen damage** is severe, likely the result of a drop or collision with a hard surface.
- While **the phone appears to still be operational** (the clock and icons display correctly), the compromised screen would make it difficult and unsafe to use effectively.
- Visible scratches and scuff marks around the edges suggest secondary contact with surfaces during the impact.
- Customer complaints would likely focus on the shattered display rendering the phone unusable and hazardous due to sharp edges on the cracked screen.
